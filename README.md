# PERFECT GRADE

### FRONTEND

Capstone project for Flatiron School DC.

Students can enter all their assignments for a given semester, and upon pressing the "Make The Grade" button, receive back a "flattened" schedule. This adjusted schedule finds days with excess assignments and shifts them backwards to produce more consistent, regular workloads across a school semester.

Special thanks on this project to Tyler Curran, Rachael Tomlinson, Meghan Wingert, Tatiyahna Blakely, Cassie Turner, and Molly Magoffin. Extra special thanks to DaYoung Lee, JC Chang, and Shannon Nabors.
